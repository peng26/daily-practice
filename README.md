# daily-practice
I write some codes by using program design language C
Recently, I wrote a number of topics for the number of daffodils, matrix addition, matrix peripheral data summation, bubble sort of strings, 
count the number of words in a string, and remove Numbers from a string. All of these problems are implemented in C.
